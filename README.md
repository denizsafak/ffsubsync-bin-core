## Development

### Server Mode (Additional Feature)

You can run the binary in server mode by adding the `--server` flag. This allows you to interact with the binary using standard CLI input and output. The serverâ€™s standard output will be in JSON format, prefixed with `[SERVER] `. For example, `[SERVER] {"status": "ready"}` indicates the server is ready.

The output will include the command queue and the result of each command. To add a command to the queue, send `add:YOUR_COMMAND` as standard input. Use `start` to initiate the queue.

Each time the server finishes executing a command, it will send the result to the standard output. Once all commands are completed, the server will output `[SERVER] {"status": "ready"}`.

Server mode is particularly useful for running multiple commands in sequence without restarting the binary, helping to address the cold start problem (since pyinstaller can be slow to start).
